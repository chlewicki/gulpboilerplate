# gulpboilerplate
quick and easy start of a new project  
  
install package with npm install  
  
main commands:  
gulp -> start a new project with browser sync  
gulp build -> create a final build with minified html, js, css, php, images and proper file paths  
  
If you are interested how it works -> check gulpfile.js, everything is properly commented.  
  
PHP local server available! You just have to quickly configure two tasks in gulpfile.js (just read the comments) and start Apache server (XAMPP FTW)  
  
Enjoy! :)
