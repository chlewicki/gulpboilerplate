# gulpboilerplate
quick and easy start of a new project  
  
install package with npm install  
  
main commands:  
gulp -> start a new project with browser sync  
gulp build -> create a final build with minified html, js, css, php, images and proper file paths   
  
PHP local server available! You just have to quickly configure two tasks in gulpfile.js (read the comments) and start Apache server (XAMPP FTW)  
  
Enjoy! :)
